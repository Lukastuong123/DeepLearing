# [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

This is my personal projects for the deep learning course from begginer level to advanced. Despite ups and downs for the past 4 months, I am extremely grateful for all the knowledge that I have accumulated in such an exciting field
